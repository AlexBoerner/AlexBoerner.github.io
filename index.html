  <h3>5 Things I love to do</h3> 
  <p3>1.   One thing I love to do is Video Game such as Rainbow 6 seige and Madden NFL 17</p>
  <p3>2.   There are many diffrent things to cook in life but when it comes to cooking there is no way you can not make cookies and brownies!YUM!</p>
  <p3>3.   Sometimes when the sun is out outside and it's not to hot and not to cold you just want to go outside and play basketball or football and maybe even baseball. These are just a few of the sports I like to do outisde.</p>
  <p3>4.   Sometimes outside it's raining so when it's raining there is no better time to go to the movies(My favorite movie is Spider Man Homecoming.)</p>
  <p3>5    Whether it's rain or shine it's always a good idea to pick up a good book and start reading.</p>
